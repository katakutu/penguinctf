When do penguins change their clothes?
They must have others, I suppose.
Can it be that they're always dressed
In party clothes, that can't be messed?
Gathered in suits of black and white
Perfect for some formal night - 
Do they expect a king or queen
To grace their distant glacial scene
It would make me feel much better
If I knew they each owned a sweater.
I know a bird
That cannot fly:
Penguin is its name.
It cannot fly,
But it can swim
With speed that wins it fame!
I know a bird
That lives on ice
And waddles by the sea.
It looks so cute
In its black-and-white suit,
As handsome as can be!
These funny birds in fancy clothes
may waddle in the snow,
but when they reach the icy sea
Just watch how fast they go!
Their song sounds like a donkey's bray,
they cannot soar or fly,
yet penguins manage very well,
and let me tell you why . . .
Their feathers keep out water,
their blubber keeps out cold,
their wings make perfect paddles
because they do not fold!
their tails are good for steering,
they brake with both their feet -
So tell me now, from all you've heard . . .
Aren't penguins NEAT?
Okay I'm pretty sick of all these stupid penguin poems
Come with me
My love to the sea
The sea of love
I wanna tell you
How much
I love you
Do you remember
When we met, that's the day
I knew you were my pet?
I wanna tell you
How much
I love you
Come with me
My love to the sea
The sea of love
I wanna tell you
How much
I love you
Neither clown nor child nor black
nor white but verticle
and a questioning innocence
dressed in night and snow:
The mother smiles at the sailor,
the fisherman at the astronaunt,
but the child child does not smile
when he looks at the bird child,
and from the disorderly ocean
the immaculate passenger
emerges in snowy mourning.
I was without doubt the child bird
there in the cold archipelagoes
when it looked at me with its eyes,
with its ancient ocean eyes:
it had neither arms nor wings
but hard little oars
on its sides:
it was as old as the salt;
the age of moving water,
and it looked at me from its age:
since then I know I do not exist;
I am a worm in the sand.
the reasons for my respect
remained in the sand:
the religious bird
did not need to fly,
did not need to sing,
and through its form was visible
its wild soul bled salt:
as if a vein from the bitter sea
had been broken.
Penguin, static traveler,
deliberate priest of the cold,
I salute your vertical salt
and envy your plumed pride.
